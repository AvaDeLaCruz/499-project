									<h3>Careers after College</h3>

									<p className="text-sm mb-0">
										â€” When determining what to do after college, there are so many options! 
										Here are some of them:
										<ul>
											<h5><li>
												Enter the workforce as a full-time employee
											</li></h5>
											Sometimes, the best option after college graduation is to take 
											an entry-level position to gain skills and experience. A 
											real-world, full-time job will help you build your 
											resume and give you the support you need to plan for your 
											future and prepare to earn your dream job.
											<h5><li>
												Continue your education in a master's program
											</li></h5>
											Graduate school is a fantastic option for those who know they 
											need a post-graduate education to meet their long-term career 
											goals. Research graduate programs and schools before applying 
											to make sure you complete a degree that will benefit your 
											intended career.
											<h5><li>
												Find an internship or co-op program
											</li></h5>
											Internships are a great way for recent graduates to gain entry 
											into competitive industries or companies. While internships can 
											pay less than full-time positions, they often result in resume 
											experience, recommendation letters and even full-time positions.
											<h5><li>
												Start your own company
											</li></h5>
											If you have an idea for a great product or a strong passion, 
											starting your own business can be the best way to create your dream job. 
											<h5><li>
												Take a gap year
											</li></h5>
											A gap year is a time of exploration and travel after high school 
											or college graduation. Often, graduates who take gap years use 
											that time to experience a new culture and build their soft skills 
											like communication and problem-solving. A gap year can be a great 
											way to gain new experiences and meet new people who may be able 
											to help you find your ideal job once you're ready.
